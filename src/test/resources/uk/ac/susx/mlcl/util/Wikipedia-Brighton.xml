'''Brighton''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Brighton.ogg|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|t|ən}} is the major part of the city and [[unitary authority]] of [[Brighton and Hove]] (formed from the previous towns of Brighton, [[Hove]], [[Portslade]] and several other villages) on the south coast of Great Britain. Formerly part of the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|non-metropolitan county]] of [[East Sussex]], it remains part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of East Sussex, within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Sussex]].

The ancient settlement of ''Brighthelmstone'' dates from before [[Domesday Book]] (1086), but it emerged as a health resort featuring [[sea bathing]] during the 18th century and became a destination for [[day-tripper]]s from London after the arrival of the railway in 1841. Brighton experienced rapid population growth, reaching a peak of over 160,000 by 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Carder, Timothy (1990). ''The Encyclopaedia of Brighton''. S.127 East Sussex County Libraries. ISBN 0-86147-315-9&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Brighton forms part of the [[Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton|Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation]] stretching along the coast, with a population of around 480,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&amp;More=Y|title=KS01 Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas|accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brighton has two universities and a medical school (which is operated jointly by both universities).

==History==
{{Main|History of Brighton}}
[[File:Brighton aquarium photochrom.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of Brighton aquarium, 1890–1900]]
In the [[Domesday Book]], Brighton was called ''Bristelmestune''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/search-results.asp?searchtype=browserefine&amp;query=place%3dbrighton&amp;catid=24&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;querytype=1|title=National Archives: Domesday Book: Brighton|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a rent of 4,000 [[herring]] was established. In June 1514 ''Brighthelmstone'' was burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war between England and France. Only part of the [[Church of St Nicholas, Brighton|St Nicholas Church]] and the street pattern of the area now known as &quot;[[The Lanes (Brighton)|The Lanes]]&quot; survived. The first drawing of Brighthelmstone was made in 1545 and depicts what is believed to be the raid of 1514.&lt;ref&gt;Carder (1990), s.17&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 1740s and 1750s, [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Dr Richard Russell]] of [[Lewes]] began prescribing [[seawater]] at Brighton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell1755&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oeconomy of Nature in Acute and Chronical Diseases of the Glands|url=http://www.archive.org/details/oeconomynaturei00russgoog|last=Russell|first=Richard| edition=8th |year=1755| publisher=John and James Rivington, London; and James Fletcher, Oxford|accessdate=7 December 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell1760&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=A Dissertation on the Use of Sea Water in the Diseases of the Glands.

From 1780, development of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian terraces]] had started and the fishing village became the fashionable [[resort]] of Brighton. Growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]) after his first visit in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Carder (1990), s.71&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the [[Brighton Pavilion|Royal Pavilion]] during the early part of his [[English Regency|Regency]]. Although contracted forms of the name are attested since the 15th Century, it was not until this period that the modern form of the name came into common use.&lt;ref&gt;Mawer, A. and F.M. Stenton, ''The Place-Names of Sussex'', Part II, Cambridge 1930, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London and population growth from around 7,000 in 1801 to over 120,000 by 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Carder (1990), s.127&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the major attractions were built during the [[Victorian era]] such as the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel (1864)]], the [[West Pier, Brighton|West Pier (1866)]] and the [[Palace Pier|Palace Pier (1899)]]. Prior to either of these structures the famous Chain Pier was built, to the designs of Captain Samuel Brown. It lasted from 1823 to 1896, and featured in paintings by both Turner and Constable.

After boundary changes between 1873 and 1952, the land area of Brighton increased from &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;1,640&amp;nbsp;acres&amp;nbsp;(7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; in 1854 to &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;14,347&amp;nbsp;acres&amp;nbsp;(58&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Carder (1990), s.13&lt;/ref&gt; New housing estates were established in the acquired areas including [[Moulsecoomb]], [[Bevendean]], [[Coldean]] and [[Whitehawk]]. The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of [[Patcham]], [[Ovingdean]] and [[Rottingdean]], and much council housing was built in parts of [[Woodingdean]] after the Second World War.

More recently, [[gentrification]] of much of Brighton has seen a return of the fashionable image which characterised the growth of the Regency period. Recent housing in the [[North Laine]], for instance, has been designed in keeping with the area.

In 1997 Brighton and Hove were joined to form the [[unitary authority]] of [[Brighton and Hove]], which was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as part of the [[millennium]] celebrations in 2000.

Brighton is sometimes referred to as London-by-the-sea.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Porter, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AYT82eXH1l0C&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=%22london+by+the+sea%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xfqbTJODLciOONSrsJQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22london%20by%20the%20sea%22&amp;f=false ''Frommer's England 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Davenport Adams, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MthIAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22london+by+the+sea%22&amp;dq=%22london+by+the+sea%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xfqbTJODLciOONSrsJQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw ''Songs of society, from Anne to Victoria''], 1880&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]], [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V1_hm9VxKv0C&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=%22london+by+the+sea%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xfqbTJODLciOONSrsJQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22london%20by%20the%20sea%22&amp;f=false ''Talk of the Town'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2005-07-14 - United Kingdom - England - Brighton - Brighton Pier.jpg|thumb|Brighton Pier]]
[[File:The Royal Pavilion Brighton.jpg|thumb|Royal Pavilion]]
The [[Royal Pavilion]] is a former royal palace built as a home for the Prince Regent during the early 19th century, under the direction of the architect John Nash, and is notable for its [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture and Oriental interior. Other Indo-Saracenic buildings in Brighton include the [[Sassoon Mausoleum]], now, with the bodies reburied elsewhere, in use as a chic supper club.

[[Brighton Pier|Brighton Marine Palace and Pier]] (long known as the Palace Pier) opened in 1899. It features a [[funfair]], restaurants and arcade halls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1333683.0.i_will_never_return_to_the_pier.php The Argus newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1385930.0.pricey_on_the_pier.php The Argus newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1396955.0.pressure_the_pier.php The Argus newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[West Pier, Brighton|West Pier]] was built in 1866 and is one of only two Grade I [[Listed building|listed]] piers in the United Kingdom. It has been closed since 1975. For some time it was under consideration for restoration, but two fires in 2003, and other setbacks, led to these plans being abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwidewet.net/ Pier Threatens To Unplug Rival (from The Argus)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for a new landmark in its place – the [[i360]], a 183&amp;nbsp;m (600&amp;nbsp;ft) observation tower designed by [[London Eye]] architects Marks Barfield – were announced in June 2006. Plans were approved by the council on 11 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/6039722.stm|title=BBC NEWS – England – Southern Counties – Tall tower rises from pier ashes|accessdate=20 August 2007 | date=11 October 2006 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009|alt=As of early 2009}}, construction had yet to begin, but the area has been cordoned off.

[[Brighton clocktower]], built in 1888 for Queen Victoria's jubilee, stands at the intersection of Brighton's busiest thoroughfares.

Created in 1883, [[Volk's Electric Railway]] runs along the inland edge of the beach from Brighton Pier to [[Black Rock (Brighton and Hove)|Black Rock]] and [[Brighton Marina]]. It is the world's oldest operating [[electric railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkselectricrailway.co.uk|title=Home page of Volks Electric Railway Group|accessdate=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] was built in 1864 and the scene of the [[Brighton Hotel Bombing|1984 Brighton Hotel Bombing]]. Its nighttime blue lighting is particularly prominent along the foreshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevirginbackpacker.com/122/day-10-checking-out-southern-england-part-i.html|title=Blog post from The Virgin Backpacker|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brighton Wheel]] opened with some controversy, directly north east of the [[Brighton Pier|Brighton Marine Palace and Pier]] in October 2011 after a previous attempt to locate it in a more central location near the Metropole Hotel, at which time it was to have been the &quot;Brighton O&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a special spokeless design&lt;ref name=&quot;ok&quot;&gt;{http://www.jasonkitcat.com/2009/11/brighton-o-k-or-o-no/ OK or O no]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the traditional spoked wheel eventually purchased from its previous home in South Africa.

===Churches and places of worship===
{{Further|List of places of worship in Brighton and Hove}}
The 11th century [[Church of St Nicholas, Brighton|St Nicholas Church]] is the oldest building in Brighton, commonly known as &quot;The Mother Church&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regencybrighton.com/outabout/st_nicholas/|title=St. Nicholas Church – Out &amp; About – Regency Square Area Society|accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable churches include the large brick-built [[St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton|St Bartholomew's]], and [[St Peter's Church, Brighton|St Peter's]] on an island between the Lewes Road and the London Road. Brighton's [[Quaker]]s run the Friends' Meeting House in the Lanes. There is an active [[Brighton Unitarian Church|Unitarian community]] based in a Grade 2 listed building in New Road, and a [[Spiritualist church]] in Norfolk Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brightonandhovespiritualistchurch.org/ Brighton and Hove Spiritualist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of [[New Age]] outlets and groups.

Brighton has three [[synagogues]], the [[Middle Street Synagogue, Brighton|Middle Street Synagogue]], a Grade II [[listed building]] built in 1874–75. It is presently in the process of being gradually restored by [[English Heritage]]. Brighton and Hove reform Synagogue, Palmeira Avenue, Hove and the progressive Synagogue, Lansdowne Road, Hove. There are also several [[mosque]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brightonmosque.com/ Al-Quds Mosque]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhmf.org.uk/al-medinah-mosque-timetable Al Medina mosque]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhist]] centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brightonbuddhistcentre.co.uk/ Brighton Buddhist Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Brighton has become known as one of the least religious places in the UK, based upon analysis of the 2011 census which revealed that 42 per cent of the population profess no religion, which is far higher than the national average of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10102833.Losing_our_religion/ | title = Brighton and Hove is country's most Godless city | }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Jedi census phenomenon]], 2.6 per cent claimed their religion was Jedi Knight, the largest percentage in the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/28/brighton_tops_uk_jedi_league/ The Register: Brighton Tops Jedi League]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beaches===
[[File:Brighton beach.jpg|thumb|Brighton's Kemp Town beach in summer]]
[[File:Boats on Brighton Beach - geograph.org.uk - 242094.jpg|thumb|Boats on Brighton Beach]]
The seafront has bars, restaurants, nightclubs and amusement arcades, principally between the piers. Being less than an hour from London by train has made the city a popular destination, especially with big party groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DoStagDo |url=http://www.dostagdo.co.uk/brighton/ |title=Brighton Stag Do |date= |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brighton beach has a [[nudist]] area (by [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]] near the easterly edge of the promenade). Brighton's beach, is a [[shingle beach]] at high tide with a flat sandy foreshore at low water, and has been awarded a [[Blue Flag Beach|blue flag]]. The [[Monarch's Way]] long-distance footpath heads west along the seafront above the beach.

Since the 1978 demolition of the Black Rock open-air [[lido]] at the eastern end of Brighton's seafront, the area has been developed and now features one of Europe's largest [[Brighton Marina|marinas]]. However, the site of the pool itself remains empty except for a skate park and graffiti wall, and further development is planned including a high-rise hotel which has aroused debate, mirroring proposals for the [[King Alfred leisure centre]] in Hove, which were shelved in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=b1153045 Developments in Brighton and Hove]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the beach adjoining Madeira Drive, to the east of the city centre, has been redeveloped into a sports complex and opened to the public in March 2007, with courts for pursuits such as [[beach volleyball]] and [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate Frisbee]] among others.

==Culture==

===Art===
Brighton's art community is showcased once a year in an artists' open house event during the [[Brighton Festival]]. On the seafront between Brighton's two piers is the Artists Quarter, a row of Victorian fishermen's workshops converted to small galleries and studio spaces, where artists, employing a variety of media and styles, publicly present their work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=c1119127 &quot;The Artists Quarter&quot;], Brighton and Hove City Council.

Each May the city hosts the [[Brighton Festival]], the second largest arts festival in the UK (after [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]]). This includes processions such as the Children's Parade, outdoor spectaculars often involving pyrotechnics, and theatre, music and visual arts in venues throughout the city, some brought into this use exclusively for the festival. The earliest feature of the festival, [[Artists Open House|the Artists' Open Houses]], are homes of artists and craftspeople opened to the public as galleries, and usually selling the work of the occupants. Since 2002, these have been organised independently of the official Festival and Fringe.

==Climate==
Brighton has an [[oceanic climate]] like the rest of Britain, but during the summer months is affected by sea breezes; temperatures by the sea can be 5 or so degrees lower than those 2+ miles inland. 

Summers are generally pleasant, although rains do occur. Generally the temperatures in July get to around 20–21 degrees during the day. During heatwaves however, daytime highs often get much higher, sometimes into the low 30s.

Winters are usually mild like most of southern Britain; however, during easterly outbreaks, snow is common. The [[South Downs]] usually shield the city from some weather, but during snow events the city is sometimes badly affected. Recent winters of 2008/9 and 2009/10 saw large snow amounts falling. December 2010 was the deepest with about 30&amp;nbsp;cm falling. Brighton sometimes is in the convergence area of snow bands.
